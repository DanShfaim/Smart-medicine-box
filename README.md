# Smart-medicine-box


This post describes a prototype of a smart medication dispenser, created with an Arduino as the controlling unit. The hardware platform and the software to support all the functionalities were created from scratch. Some of the functionalities include the possibility to connect the dispenser to a smartphone using bluetooth module, or to communicate with a remote server through the internet, using ESP32 wifi.
